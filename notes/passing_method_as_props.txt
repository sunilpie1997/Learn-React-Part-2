    Passing method as Props

        ->  Suppose you want to invoke method of parent Component when button in
            child component is clicked.

            Then you need to pass that method as 'Props' to child component 

        ->  ex: 'greetHandler()' in 'ParentComponent' is executed when
            button in 'ChildComponent' is clicked.


    
    Passing parameters to above method

        ->  use arrow function.Pass the parameters and call method using Props with parameters.

        ->  ex:'greetHandlerWithParam()' in 'ParentComponent'
